libmatemixer
============

libmatemixer is a mixer library for MATE desktop.

It provides an abstract API allowing access to mixer functionality available
in the PulseAudio, ALSA and OSS sound systems.

Documentation for the API is provided with gtk-doc.

Installation and packaging
==========================

The library includes dynamically loaded modules which provide access to each
of the supported sound systems.

By default configure auto-detects whether support for PulseAudio and ALSA
is available in the system. Make sure to install the appropriate development
packages to allow the modules to be built.

Building the OSS module is only advised on non-Linux systems as OSS support
in Linux is only provided as an ALSA emulation layer. To build the OSS module,
you will need to pass --enable-oss=yes to configure.

As the modules are loaded dynamically each time an application utilizes the
library, it is possible to provide the modules in separate distribution
packages.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the MATE bug tracking system on GitHub:
